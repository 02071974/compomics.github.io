GUI application faciliates to perform the comparison of given two data sets. GUI can be started by running a command prompt on a folder that contains scoring_pipeline-X.Y.Z.jar (X.Y.Z shows the current version number). On the command prompt, the following line needs to be executed:

> java -cp scoring_pipeline-1.0.jar main.ScorePipelineStarter

GUI starts after executing this command:

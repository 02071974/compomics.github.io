## Project, experiment, and sample

Colims provides tree layout to be able to keep the runs in an organized way. User can create different projects and each project can have multiple experiments and each experiment can include desired number of samples. Sample is the leaf node of the tree where runs are stored.

Project permissions are available at the project-level administration panel. Experiment and sample management stages let user to add additional information like storage location and related attachments. In sample management stage, protocols and materials used in the analytical runs can be stored.

## Analytical run addition

The first step to store analytical run is to click "other" button on the left buttom of the main page. From the menu as it is seen below, "add run(s)..." option should be selected.

This selection will redirect to analytical run addition panel. At the moment, colims stores Peptide Shaker and MaxQuant data. Type of data to be selected is available on the left hand side of the panel.

### Data type selection

![](https://github.com/compomics/colims/wiki/maxquant_add_run.png)

Since maxQuant data has protein quantification information, relevant label chemistry should be selected by the user in order to parse correct quantification information. It is also important to provide protein quantification label for MzTab export. For non-labeled experiments, "label free" option is available.

### File selection

Since Peptide Shaker and MaxQuant have different type and amount of data to parse, colims provides two different panels for file selection. 

![](https://github.com/compomics/colims/wiki/peptide_shaker_file_add.png)

This window allows the selection of Peptide Shaker files and fasta file used in Peptide Shaker. After adding files, finish button will start the parsing and the saving process.

Since a MaxQuant experiment can have more than one combined folder, user can store each of them seperately. MqPar file is common for all combined folders and also there might be more MqPar files, so its path should be provided. MqPAr is an xml file that is used in order to do mappings between runs and protein quantification values by using experiment names. However MaxQuant allows user to create MqPar file with empty experiments section. For this reason, user should be careful that experiments tag of the xml file cannot be empty.

Since the size of unidentified spectra might be too big and some users may not want to store proteins from contaminant fasta file, these data imports are optional.

#### Fasta files

While Peptide Shaker import needs only one fasta file, MaxQuant uses primary and contaminant fasta files. In some cases there might be additional fasta files for MaxQuant. Colims stores fasta file information, therefore user should define fasta file before parsing.

If fasta files are saved before, user can select the related fasta file. There is also a filter option by fasta file type. Fasta files are editable and user can add another fasta file.

While adding a fasta file to database, choosing correct header parse rule (for MaxQuant only) and providing database name are crucial. Colims provides databases listed in EMBL-EBI website. Since MzTab export must include database information of the fasta file, mapping should be provided by the user. Also, Colims parses fasta files and creates map using protein accession as a key. Protein IDs in protein group file (MaxQuant) and keys in fasta database map should match. Since protein group files differ and there are many type of fasta files, user should test by clicking the "test" button next to the parse rule. If it is needed, a new regular expression (parse rule) can be added by clicking on the "add" button. For contaminants, the same parse rule used for primary fasta file can be chosen.

#### Label selection

Label selection is shown when there is SILAC or iCAT labeled experiment (MaxQuant only). In order to keep the database size minimal user is asked to choose label of interest whereas those experiments have many labels. 

![](https://github.com/compomics/colims/wiki/label_selection.png)

User can click on the optional header(s) from "availabe" frame and move it to "added" frame. All selected optional quantification values and mandatory ones will be stored in the database.

## Update delete analytical run

The first step to view analytical runs is to click "other" button on the left buttom of the main page. From the menu as it is seen below, "view runs..." option should be selected.

Analytical runs can be viewed, updated and deleted.

## Export

Colims generates mzIdentML file which is the HUPO-PSI standard for protein/peptide identifications in order user to do complete submission to Pride. Another export option of colims is MzTab which is light-weight, easy to parse  tab-delimited file format. It contains minimal information required to evaluate the results of a proteomics experiment.

# Compomics Documentation Website

This repository contains the compomics.github.io site, which collates documentation from all Compomics projects on Github. The site is built automatically as the result of a Jenkins build triggered by a Github webhook. This runs a Groovy postbuild script (see [https://gist.github.com/iain8/d6cd41e4e2ef920c50af](here)) which passes the project name and github url to the script `generate-docs.py`, which retrieves the readme and wiki files and adds the necessary front-matter for Jekyll to parse them. Links in wiki pages are automatically amended to still point to the correct place.

The site can be viewed locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve` (useful for troubleshooting). It is strongly advised to separate all elements in a markdown file with newlines, as the jekyll parser is a lot less forgiving than the one on github wiki pages.

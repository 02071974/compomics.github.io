### Adding Jobs To A Run

* Jobs can be added to processes through the processes section of the main GUI after selecting a run. This is not recommended to create larger runs, as the jobs are created one by one this way.

* It is however possible to batch insert jobs by importing a configuration file. Select a run in the main window and then navigate to File>Open job(s). Alternatively, you can press the "+" button to the right of the process window or right click a selected run and select "Attach jobs".

* Another option is to load a template XML file and a configuration file simultanously in order to instantly set up a run and jobs. This can be done by clicking File > Import Run in the main GUI screen

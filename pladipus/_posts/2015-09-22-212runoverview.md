### Main GUI

Users can oversee the proceedings of runs and their jobs. A status update is posted by the executing workers to the controller and these can be viewed through the user interface.

By right clicking the selected runs, the user is provided with an option to either start a run, cancel a run (withdraw it from Pladipus) or delete the run.

Similarly, when selected jobs are right clicked, the user can start/cancel and even modify those individual jobs.
